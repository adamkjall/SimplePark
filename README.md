Application description:
The app displays a map view using OpenStreetMaps. Upon starting, the app displays all surrounding parking spots in Gothenburg.
The bottom left button centers the map on the user and enables tracking. The top left button is a drop down menu which contains two filters. One for displaying and routing the user to the closest parking spot and one for the cheapest parking spot. 

Any individual parking spot can also be clicked to get a route to it and display information about it. The parking spots are also color coded. Green = many available spots, Yellow = a few available spots, Red = no available spots, Black = no information available.
